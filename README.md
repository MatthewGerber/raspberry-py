# RPI
This package provides two related capabilities. [First](rpi/python-gpio.md), it provides a high-level, event-driven 
Python interface for GPIO circuits running on the Raspberry Pi. Sensors, motors, LEDs, switches, and many other 
components are covered. [Second](rpi/remote-gpio.md), this package enables remote control of GPIO circuits via REST APIs 
invoked from HTML/JavaScript front-ends. Want to control your circuit remotely from your phone? Look no further. This 
package auto-generates HTML/JavaScript for GPIO circuits based on 
[Material Design for Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com). These HTML/JavaScript elements can be embedded in full web 
pages for remote control of the ciruit.
