# Python Interface for GPIO Circuits
This package provides two related capabilities. [First](https://matthewgerber.github.io/raspberry_py/raspberry_py/python-gpio.html), it 
provides a high-level, event-driven Python interface for GPIO circuits running on the Raspberry Pi. Sensors, motors, 
LEDs, switches, and many other components are covered. An example is shown below (click to watch; Python code 
[here](https://github.com/MatthewGerber/raspberry-py/blob/main/src/raspberry_py/gpio/examples/buzzing_led_bar_with_button.py)):

# Remote Control of GPIO Circuits via REST/HTML/JavaScript
[Second](https://matthewgerber.github.io/raspberry_py/raspberry_py/remote-gpio.html), this package enables remote 
control of GPIO circuits via REST APIs invoked from HTML/JavaScript front-ends. Want to control your circuit remotely 
from your phone? Look no further. This package auto-generates HTML/JavaScript for GPIO circuits based on 
[Material Design for Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com). These HTML/JavaScript elements can be embedded in full web 
pages for remote control of the ciruit. The remote control screen for the 
[Freenove Smart Car](https://matthewgerber.github.io/raspberry_py/raspberry_py/smart-car.html) is shown below:
