# Parts and Materials

Required
* [Copper sheet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1ZZLR97?th=1):  Used to build commutator plates.
* [30 AWG enameled magnet wire](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UWCXRK6?th=1):  Used to create electromagnetic windings.
* [Soft iron rod](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNNCZ4ZR):  Enhances the field strength of electromagnetic windings.
* Hacksaw:  Or some other way to cut lengths of the soft iron rod.
* [Ceramic magnets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S75MD7X?th=1):  Forms the fixed stator fields of the motor.
* [Bearings](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B8VZJGD):  Holds the rotor.
* [Carbon motor brushes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CVT2TG8):  Conducts current from a source to the commutator by physical contact.
* [Superglue](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ELV2D0Y):  Used in a couple spots to hold parts together (e.g., commutator plates to the rotor).
* [Shrink tubing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MFA3OFA?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1):  For soldered connections.
* Thin-gauge wire (e.g., 22 AWG jumper cables as provided in kits like [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06W54L7B5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)):  For providing current to the carbon motor brushes.
* Soldering iron:  Wire connections.
* Solder:  Wire connections.
* [DC power supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087LY94T6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1):  This is usable depending on the total resistance of the windings. If the resistance is too low because the windings are too small, then this power supply will short and self-disable.
* [DC power jack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QJAW9F4?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1):  To connect power from the supply to the carbon motor brushes.
* Lots of patience:  Given all of the parts freshly printed, it likely takes several hours to build and assemble.

Optional but useful
* [Soldering station](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHHVP467?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1):  The connections, particularly to the commutator, are challenging without this handy tool.
* [Autoranging multimeter](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=autoranging+multimeter&crid=2RJH49VDBDN9Y&sprefix=autoranging%2Caps%2C68&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_11):  Very helpful in checking winding resistance and circuit integrity.
